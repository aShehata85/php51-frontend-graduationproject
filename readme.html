    ================================================
    <p>1. FLEX took time to understand its charactrisitcs to handle.</p>
    <p>2. Sticky-nav still shows even when using diplay: none with media query.</p>
    <p>3. Along the page there is white blank part makes scrolling to right in the page even after media query usage.
    </p>
    <p>4. In Sticky-nav as you will see, the logo and menu not in same line (and this is old issue since we started the
        course).</p>
    <p>5. Burger-menu is not opening !!!</p>
    <p>6. General thing, when using flex with pictures they are bot centered all time, i worked with margin/padding to
        handle it.</p>
    <p>7. In Symptoms section, the photos didn't come in center and came to right instead.</p>
    <p>8. In Symptoms section, the blue danger traingle didn't work with me to get it beside the paragraph, it keeps
        sticky.</p>
    <p>9. general thing, when putting pictures in the round borders and when moving them, the border becomes oval.</p>
    <p>10. In protect section, the photos to the left not centered.</p>
    <p>11. In DO section, the signs of right and wrong with circles, not aligned as the exapmle page, and when using
        media query get out of the picture and i had to remove them when using the media query.</p>
    <p>12. In DO section the pictures not aligned in same line some of them above the line !!!</p>
    <p>13. In recent section, i had challenges when resizing the pictures.</p>
    <p>14. In FOOTER, i tried many time to adjust the line height in QUICK LINK, HELPFUL LINK and IMPORTANT LINK but i
        couldn't adjust as the exaplme template.</p>
    <p>15. The scroll-up button, couldn't make the ease-in-out option</p>
