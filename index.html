                            <p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living
                                in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                                disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or

                                Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                                blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                            <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others,
                                such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between
                                people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle
                                East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two
                                other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

                            <p>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections
                                were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                                person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                                continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are
                                less so.</p>
                            <P>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the
                                community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means
                                people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how
                                or where they became infected.</P>

                            <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is
                                actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends
                                that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick
                                they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.</p>
                            <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone

                                prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering

                                results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>
                            <P>Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a
                                case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:</P>
                            <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
                            <p>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</p>
                            <p>The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens
                                collected at least 24 hours apart.</p>
                            <p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of

                                respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                                associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                                your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the
                                day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the

                            <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO
                                website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries
                                around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks.
                                Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping
                                their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the
                                latest news.</p>
                            <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
                                precautions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash
                                    them with soap and water.</li>
                                <p>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
                                    viruses that may be on your hands.</p>
                                <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is
                                    coughing or sneezing.</li>
                                <p>Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose
                                    or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the
                                    droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>
                                <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
                                <p>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can
                                    transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your
                                    body and can make you sick.</p>
                                <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This
                                    means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or
                                    sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</li>
                                <P>Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the
                                    people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</P>
                                <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing,
                                    seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local
                                    health authority.</li>
                                <p>Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the
                                    situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to
                                    quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help
                                    prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
                                <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where
                                    COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially
                                    if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.</li>
                                <p>Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.</p>

                            <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                                associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                                your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the
                                day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                                bathroom.</p>
                            <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that
                                has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but
                                this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                            <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is
                                likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a
                                period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>
